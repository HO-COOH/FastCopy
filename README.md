A GUI wrapper for Windows' built-in `robocopy` ~~and `xcopy`~~.

## Features
- Easy to use copy/paste/move/delete dialog, just like your good old explorer, but much faster🚀

- Support the new Windows 11 context menu, and the old windows context menu, with the fluent design icon adapted to Light/Dark theme

## Installation (before publish to Microsoft Store)
1. Go to the [Release Page](https://github.com/HO-COOH/FastCopy/releases), download the zip file in the **Asset** section of the latest version
2. Unzip, double-click to open the certificate file ended in `.cert`, click `Install Certificate`. Choose `Local Machine` in the dialog, click `Next`
  ![](Screenshots/open_cert.png)
3. Choose `Place all certificates in the following store`, click `Browser`, and in the dialog choose `Trusted root certification authorities`
![](Screenshots/install-cert.png)
4. Then click `Next` and finally `Finish` to install the certificate.
5. Now you can double-click the `msix` to install the app.
6*. **In rare situations, you might need to restart `explorer.exe` to see `FastCopy` in the right-click context menu**

## Usage
1. Using file explorer, select some files/folders, as many as you want >> right click >> move to **FastCopy** >> select **Copy** or **Move**
2. Go to destination folder, right click at empty space >> move to **FastCopy** >> select **Paste**



## Development
### Project structure
```
FastCopy
    FastCopy\               --- Main project
    FastCopyShellExtension\ --- A dll project for registering the new Windows context menu
    SpeedTest\              --- A speed test project for measuring various copying method under Windows
    UnitTest\               --- Unit test for above projects
    FastCopy.sln            --- The solution file for all the projects
```
### Build pre-requisites
- Visual Studio 2019+, with C++20 support & Universal Windows development workload
- Windows App Sdk, with C++ template
- Additional dependencies per project:
  + FastCopy:
    - spdlog
    - boost-algorithm
  + SpeedTest:
    - abseil
    - ftxui
    - cereal

[vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) is the recommended package manager to handle these dependencies. 
You can install them with one command, and do no more.
```
vcpkg install boost-algorithm:x64-windows
vcpkg install spdlog:x64-windows
vcpkg install abseil:x64-windows
vcpkg install ftxui:x64-windows
vcpkg install cereal:x64-windows
``` 

Other component comes from my very own [WinUIEssentials](https://github.com/HO-COOH/WinUIEssentials), which will be installed automatically by Visual Studio nuget.

### Known issue
- App crash after the window closed (does not affect users, low priority)

### Recommendation
Please install the [Child Process Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool2022), so that the debugger would break at the copying process (after you launch the settings process). 
That is, you run the program first (so it goes into settings), then copy-paste a file, then the debugger will break automatically. 
Strongly recommended! 

## Translation
For contribution to translation, there are 2 places to be translated:
- The main project, in `FastCopy/Strings/<language>/Resources.resw`
- The shell extension project, in `FastCopyShellExtension/CopyOperationNames.cpp CopyOperationNames::GetInstance()`

## Technical details
### Speed comparison
In the `SpeedTest` project, you can find the speed comparison between various copying methods we investigated. A table for summary:

| Method | Copy | Move | Delete|
|--------|------|------|-------|
|xcopy|✅|❌|❌|
|robocopy|✅|✅|❌|
|std::filesystem|✅|✅|✅|
|IFileOperation|✅|✅|✅|
|SHFileOperation|✅|✅|✅|

My spec:
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 9950x
- SSD
  + Same drive: Samsung 870 QVO 1TB @ SATA 6Gbps
  + Different drive: Fanxiang S500 Pro 2TB @ PCI-E 3.0 4x -> Samsung 870 QVO 1TB @ SATA 6Gbps
- Motherboard: MSI X870 Tomahawk Wifi


The Results:

1. Copy same drive -> same drive:

|Method         | 1 GB of 4 KB small files | 4 GB of 1 GB large files |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
|xcopy          | 2:29					   | ~~0:00~~                 |
|robocopy       |  **2:19**		           |  **0:30**				  |
|std::filesystem| 2:25   		           | 0:54				      |
|IFileOperation | 6:19   			       | ~~0:00~~			      |
|SHFileOperation| 8:59  			       | ~~0:00~~       	      |

*IFileOperation and SHFileOperation actually keeps eating 100% of Disk usage in taskmgr after the API returns, 
meaning the API does an early return, which does not really counts.


2. Copy different drive -> different drive:

|Method         | 1 GB of 4 KB small files | 4 GB of 1 GB large files |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
|xcopy          | 2:20					   | ~~0:00~~                 |
|robocopy       |  **1:58**		           | **0:08**                 |
|std::filesystem| 2:39   		           | ~~0:01~~                 |
|IFileOperation | 6:12   			       | ~~0:00~~                 |
|SHFileOperation| 8:50				       | ~~0:00~~	              |


3. Move same drive -> same drive:

|Method         | 1 GB of 4 KB small files | 4 GB of 1 GB large files |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
|xcopy          | N/A                      | N/A                      |
|robocopy       | 2:52                     |  **0:17**				  |
|std::filesystem| ~~0:00~~                 | ~~0:00~~    		      |
|IFileOperation | 3:44                     | ~~0:01~~			      |
|SHFileOperation| 5:31                     | ~~0:00~~     		      |


4. Move different drive -> different drive:

|Method         | 1 GB of 4 KB small files | 4 GB of 1 GB large files |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
|xcopy          | N/A                      | N/A                      |
|robocopy       | **2:25**                 | 0:08   				  |
|std::filesystem| N/A                      | N/A	    		      |
|IFileOperation | 12:58                    | 0:08    			      |
|SHFileOperation| 15:48 			       | **0:06**      		      |


5. Delete:

|Method         | 1 GB of 4 KB small files | 4 GB of 1 GB large files |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
|xcopy          | N/A                      | N/A                      |
|robocopy       | N/A                      | N/A				      |
|std::filesystem| **0:19**                 | 0:01				      |
|IFileOperation | 0:42                     | ~~0:00~~			      |
|SHFileOperation| 2:28			           | ~~0:00~~      		      |

### Parsing `robocopy` output
1. New file line has the form of this
```
New File  		     485	CMakeLists.txt	20:58 -> 20:58
```
This can be matched with **staring with `New File` and containing 4 segments after split with `\t`**
```cpp
std::string_view{line}.starts_with("New File");
std::vector<absl::string_view> v = absl::StrSplit(s.data(), "\t", absl::SkipEmpty()); 
/*
    New File
    485
    CMakeLists.txt
    xx:xx -> xx:xx
*/
```
2. New folder line has the form of this
```
New Dir       2000	D:\computecpp-sdk\.git\refs\
```
This can be matched with **starting with `New Dir` and containing 2 segments after split with `\t`** (the spacing between `New Dir` and number are spaces, not `\t`)
```cpp
std::string_view{line}.starts_with("New Dir");
std::vector<std::string> splitted = absl::StrSplit(absl::string_view{ line.data(), line.length() }, "\t", absl::SkipEmpty());
/*
    New Dir       2000
    D:\computecpp-sdk\.git\refs\
*/
std::pair<std::string, std::string> count = absl::StrSplit(splitted[0], "  ", absl::SkipEmpty());
/*
    New Dir
    2000
*/
```
