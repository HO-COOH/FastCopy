# AppxDllRules.txt
#
# One pattern per line.
# - Matching is case-insensitive.
# - Patterns are applied to file names only (no directory path).
# - Optional "| soft" means:
#     If the target file already exists and overwriting fails
#     (for example, the file is in use), treat it as a soft error:
#     log a warning but do NOT fail the whole build.
#
# To enable the same "soft on overwrite failure" behavior globally
# for all patterns, you can add ONE of the following directive lines:
#   @SoftOnTargetLocked
#   @soft_on_target_locked
#
# Lines starting with '#' or ';' are comments.

# boost filesystem: must copy successfully (hard error on failure)
boost_filesystem-vc143-mt*-x64-1_86.dll

# fmt family: fmt.dll / fmtd.dll (still hard error by default)
fmt*.dll

# FastCopy shell extension:
#  - "| soft" means: if the target DLL already exists and the overwrite fails,
#    treat it as a soft error (warning only, build continues).
# use "| SoftOnTargetLocked", "| soft-on-target-locked" as well.
FastCopyShellExtension.dll | soft

# Robocopy injection DLL: failure is a hard error (no "| soft"), maybe we need a sign?
RobocopyInjection.dll
